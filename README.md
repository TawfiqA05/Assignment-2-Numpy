Basketball Data Analysis Project

Project Purpose:
This project aims to analyze basketball player statistics across multiple seasons to provide insights into player performance. By evaluating key performance metrics such as shooting accuracy, scoring efficiency, and defensive contributions, the analysis assists analysts, coaches, and teams in making informed decisions based on historical data.

Design and Implementation:
The project is structured to handle and analyze basketball statistics efficiently. The primary component processes the dataset, computes required statistics, and ensures modularity, readability, and reusability.

Key Functionalities:
- Loading and processing the dataset.
- Calculating field goal, three-point, and free throw accuracy.
- Determining points per minute and overall shooting efficiency.
- Analyzing defensive contributions such as blocks and steals per game.
- Extracting top-performing players based on various metrics.
- Exporting the processed results for further analysis.

Limitations:
- Missing data may lead to gaps in statistical calculations.
- Changes in gameplay rules and external factors are not considered.
- The analysis focuses on predefined statistical categories without incorporating advanced metrics dynamically.

This project provides essential insights into basketball analytics and serves as a foundation for further performance evaluations and strategic planning.
